## Working Example:

Some sample images are provided in *./data/images/* and the model weights are stored in *./classifier/models/combined_model.pth*

Run the commands: 

conda create -n "env" python=3.9.9
conda activate env
pip install -r requirements.txt

Install the requirements and open *./classifier/working_example.ipynb*.

Run the cells to do inference on the sample images in *./data/images/*.
